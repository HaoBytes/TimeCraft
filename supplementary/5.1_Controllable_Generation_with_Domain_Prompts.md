# ðŸ“˜ 5.1 Controllable Generation with Domain Prompts

In this mode, TimeCraft leverages learned **semantic prototypes** (also referred to as "domain prompts") to control the generation of synthetic time-series data. These prototypes encode structural or categorical properties of specific domains (e.g., medical, financial, climate), enabling the model to generate data that conforms to domain-specific characteristics without relying on explicit textual input.

This setup is ideal for:
- Cross-domain generation using a few representative samples
- Ablation studies (prototype-only guidance)
- Low-resource settings where textual descriptions are unavailable

**Example Command:**

```bash
python inference.py \
  --base config.yaml \
  --resume true \
  --ckpt_name ./checkpoints/ \
  --use_pam
```

> âœ… `--use_pam` enables prototype-based control
